## Getting Started

### Prepare

Begin by [installing Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) if you have not done so already.

You can test your install by calling the following command:

```shell
go version
```

Your version must be greater than or equal to the version defined in `./go.mod` file.

### Install, Verify, and Build

Install, verify, and build `./deterge` binary.

```shell
nvm use && make
```

### Help

Learn about the available commands in the help menu.

```shell
./deterge --help
```

See [Commands](#commands) section for more information.

## Verification

### Linting

-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
-   [gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt)

```shell
make lint
```

These rules can then be automatically applied:

```shell
make format
```

### Unit Testing

```shell
make test
```

### Concepts

#### Internationalization

> 💡️ Perhaps using a package like [nicksnyder/go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n). The currently selected language could be discovered from the environment, e.g. `LANG=en_AU.UTF-8` for command line and [Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) header, e.g. `Accept-Language: en-AU,en;q=0.9` for the web ui.

### Security Mitigations

> Initially based on the [OWASP Top 10 - 2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
